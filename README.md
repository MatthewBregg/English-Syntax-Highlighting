# English-Syntax-Highlighting

A quick hack I made one night that adds syntax highlighting to the english langauges.
USes the epc rpc library to call python nltk.

Is not automatic, much be explicitly ran on some text.

Couldn't think of a better way to do it, so dedicated font face for each word type.

Font-lock mode must be off.

Should not be taken seriously.
